# Note
If using Google Chrome, you need to use the Tampermonkey extension instead of Greasemonkey for Firefox.

I do not update these scripts for Chrome as frequently. I also don't test these scripts as extensively, so bugs are more likely.

I encourage you to use Firefox if you want to use these scripts (and to use Firefox just in general).
